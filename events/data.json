After this, all the questions will contain answers that have the length of words between 1 and 6. These answers are analogous to the dice numbers 1 to 6. Upon answering, the participant may move steps equal to the number of words.  If answered wrong, the participant is not allowed to move. The team that has all its members reach the finish line wins.
